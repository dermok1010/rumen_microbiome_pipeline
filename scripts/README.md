# Rumen Microbiome Analysis

This project processes 16S rRNA sequencing data frat rumen samples to generate genus-level relative abundances and calculate alpha diversity metrics.Using Qiime package raw fasta files are checked deoinised and matched with SILVA refernce database

Qiime output files were generated and data was also exported to python (jupyter) in which nromalised relative abundances and diversity metrics were calculatedall pandas numpy scipy
